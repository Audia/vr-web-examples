## VR Web Examples

Example scenes that make it easy to start creating VR web experiences.

### Scenes

* [Basic Three.js VR Scene](http://mozvr.github.io/vr-web-examples/threejs-vr-boilerplate/)
    - *WebGL with Three.js is our recommended tool for creating VR web experience.*
* [DOM VR Skybox](http://mozvr.github.io/vr-web-examples/domvr-skybox/)
* [DOM VR Birds](http://mozvr.github.io/vr-web-examples/domvr-birds/)
    - *DOM VR is not supported in current builds of VR Firefox or Chromium.*

### Requirements

These examples are best viewed using a VR enabled browser using a Oculus Rift DK1 or DK2 VR headset. The standard versions of these browsers will display the scenes, but you will not be able to enter VR mode.

* [Download experimental Firefox VR builds](http://mozvr.com/downloads.html)
* [Download experimental Chromium VR builds](https://drive.google.com/a/google.com/folderview?id=0BzudLt22BqGRbW9WTHMtOWMzNjQ&usp=sharing#list)

You will also need a compatible VR headset. Currently the Oculus Rift DK1 and DK2 headsets are supported. Support for Cardboard and other headsets coming soon.


### Controls

* `Double click` to enter full-screen VR mode.
